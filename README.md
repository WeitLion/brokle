# 📊🚀 Brokle - AI Observability & Gateway Platform

**Production-grade observability and routing for LLM apps** – Your first step toward complete AI infrastructure.

*Built for transparency, extensibility, and control — with the flexibility of open source.*

## 🎯 Current Capabilities
- **Observe** – 40+ AI-specific metrics with real-time insights
- **Route** – OpenAI-compatible with smart multi-provider routing  
- **Trace & Optimize** – End-to-end visibility and cost insights

## 🗺️ Our Vision

Brokle is starting with **observability and gateway** as the foundation.  
Here's what we're exploring next (no strict timeline):

🔄 **Semantic Caching** – Reduce latency & costs  
🚀 **Model Hosting** – Expand beyond text LLMs  
🌐 **Unified Platform** – Bring it all together

Our long-term goal is the unified AI infrastructure platform — starting with what production teams need most: visibility and control.
